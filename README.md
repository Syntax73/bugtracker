# BugTracker

A system that manages bugs in a project. This project still in development and may have some bugs (How ironic :smile:).

## Tools

This are all the tools used in this project.

- :zap: **Express** - Minimal HTTP web framework
- :pencil: **Sequelize** - A SQL ORM
- :heartbeat: **VueJS** - A library to build user interfaces
- :nail_care: **Lint** - Eslint/Prettier

## Getting started

You need to have `NodeJS` instaled in your machine. Then, you can clone the repository and run the following commands in the project folder. I recomend you read the [README](./backend/README.md) in the backend for further explanation.

1. `yarn` - to install all the dependecies
2. `cd backend/ && yarn dev` - enter the backend folder and start the serve
3. `cd frontend/ && yarn serve` - enter the frontend folder and start the spa
